# Stack
Program Aim:
The aim of the given code is to provide a simple menu-driven program that allows users to perform operations related to infix-to-postfix expression conversion. 
It enables users to input infix expressions, convert them to postfix expressions, display the converted expressions, and view the current state of the stack.

Theory:
The code defines a program that uses a stack data structure to perform infix-to-postfix conversion on mathematical expressions. The key elements include:

A function isOperator to check if a character is an operator (+, -, *, /).
A function getPrecedence to determine the precedence of an operator.
A function infixToPostfix that takes an infix expression as input, converts it to postfix using a stack, and returns the result.
The main part of the code provides a menu-driven interface for users to input infix expressions and view the corresponding postfix expressions. It utilizes a stack to handle these expressions and user choices.

Algorithm:

Define the functions isOperator and getPrecedence to identify operators and determine their precedence.

Define the infixToPostfix function for infix-to-postfix conversion using a stack.

Iterate through each character in the input infix expression.
If the character is an operand, add it to the postfix expression.
If the character is an open parenthesis '(', push it onto the operator stack.
If the character is a closing parenthesis ')':
Pop operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression until an open parenthesis is encountered.
Pop and discard the open parenthesis.
If the character is an operator:
While the stack is not empty and the operator at the top of the stack has higher or equal precedence than the current operator, pop the stack and add the popped operator to the postfix expression.
Push the current operator onto the stack.
Continue this process for all characters in the input expression.
After the loop, pop any remaining operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression.
Return the postfix expression.
In the main function:

Use a stack and string variables to store infix and postfix expressions.
Display a menu for user interaction.
Allow users to push an infix expression onto the stack, convert and display it, view the current stack, or exit the program.
Conclusion:

This code demonstrates a menu-driven program for infix-to-postfix expression conversion. Users can input infix expressions, and the code converts them to postfix using a stack. The menu allows users to interact with the stack, providing options to push, pop, and display expressions. The code handles operator precedence, open and close parentheses, and provides a simple way to work with mathematical expressions.
